# US-Car-Accident-Data-Exploration
## How to avoid car accidents: A study of US accidents from 2016 to 2020

In this project, I analyze the US A Countrywide Traffic Accident Dataset (2016 - 2020) from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents).
It relates the number of accidents with the time, the area and the surroundings of where the accidents happen.. It also includes a study on the relation of the many variables in the dataset to the accident severity.

## <a id="motivation"/> Project Motivation
The motivation behind this project was to develop skills related to communicating the insights of data analysis, always following the CRISP-DM process.
I choose this dataset, examined it and came up with business question related to car accidents. Gained business and data understanding, prepared the data, performed the data anlyses and presented the results. Finally, shared those same results in this [post](https://medium.com/@joaquimpedrosantos/how-to-prevent-car-accidents-e529719b1c07). 

The business questions were:
1.Where do most accidents happen?

-Where the accidents happen countrywide? 
-Do some regions have more accidents than other?

2.What are the surroundings of the accidents?

-Do the accidents take place in juntions? 
-Proximity to traffic objects (surroundings)

3.When do most accidents happen?

-Is there a specific time of the day where there are more accidents reported? Hours with the most traffic(the beginning of the day and the end of the day)?
-How many accidents do we have per month? What about per year?

4.What relates to accident severity?
-Is it related to where the accident happens?
-Is it related to the weather conditions?
-What variables correlate the most with a severity of an accident
